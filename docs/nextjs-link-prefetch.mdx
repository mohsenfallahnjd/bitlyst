## 🚦 What is `prefetch`?

In Next.js, `<Link>` can **prefetch** the code + data for the target page *before you click*.  
That means when the user actually clicks, navigation feels **instant**.

---

## ⚙️ How it works under the hood

1. When a `<Link>` appears in the **viewport**, Next.js triggers a **prefetch request**:
   - The **JavaScript bundle** for that route.
   - In App Router (`/app`), also the **React Server Component (RSC) payload**.

2. Prefetching uses an **IntersectionObserver** so links outside the screen aren’t prefetched unnecessarily.

3. If you hover/focus a link, Next.js may also prefetch aggressively.

4. When you click, Next.js already has the assets in the **router cache**, so navigation happens with **zero extra network latency**.

---

## 🛠 Usage

```tsx
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <nav>
      {/* Prefetch ON (default in production) */}
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>

      {/* Explicitly disable prefetch */}
      <Link href="/contact" prefetch={false}>
        Contact
      </Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

- ✅ **Default in production**: `<Link>` prefetches.  
- ⚠️ **Development mode**: Prefetching is disabled (to avoid interfering with HMR).

---

## 📦 App Router specifics (Next.js 13+)

- Prefetch loads both the **code bundle** and the **RSC payload** (`.rsc` file).  
- These are stored in the **Router cache**, so clicking doesn’t trigger a new fetch unless stale.  
- With `fetch` inside Server Components, cache control (`force-cache`, `no-store`) determines whether the prefetched data is reused or refetched.

---

## 🎯 When to disable `prefetch`

- If you render **too many links** (e.g., a large list/table), prefetching all would waste bandwidth.  
- In those cases, use `prefetch={false}` or dynamically load links only when visible.

---

## 🧠 Mental model

- `<Link prefetch>` = “warm up the router with everything this page needs, before the user clicks.”  
- This is why Next.js apps often feel faster than plain SPAs: navigation happens instantly, without waiting for the network.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Next.js prefetch loads **JS bundles + data** when a link is visible.  
- Prefetch is **enabled by default in production**.  
- Use `prefetch={false}` when you have many links and want to avoid wasted requests.  
- In App Router, prefetch also warms up the **RSC payload** in the router cache.

✨ Result: smoother, almost instant page transitions.
