# useDeferredValue Explained

`useDeferredValue` is a **React concurrent hook** that lets you **delay rendering of non-urgent values** so your UI stays responsive.

---

## 🧩 What Problem Does `useDeferredValue` Solve?

It helps prevent UI lag when rendering is expensive but user input must remain fast.

---

## ⚙️ Basic Usage

```tsx
import { useDeferredValue, useState } from "react";

function Search() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);

  return (
    <>
      <input value={query} onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)} />
      <Results query={deferredQuery} />
    </>
  );
}
```

---

## 🧠 Mental Model

- `query` updates immediately
- `deferredQuery` updates when React has time

---

## 🔍 How It Works Under the Hood

- Deferred updates are marked **low priority**
- Urgent updates interrupt them
- Intermediate renders may be skipped

---

## ⚡ useDeferredValue vs useTransition

| Feature | useDeferredValue | useTransition |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Controls | Value | State update |
| API | Passive | Active |
| Pending flag | ❌ | ✅ |

---

## 🧱 Example: Filtering a Large List

```tsx
const deferredFilter = useDeferredValue(filter);
```

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Not a debounce
- Requires React 18+
- Delays rendering, not state

---

## ✅ Summary

`useDeferredValue` improves UX by prioritizing urgent updates and deferring expensive rendering.
