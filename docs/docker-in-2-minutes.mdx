Docker lets you package an app **with everything it needs** (system libs, runtime, config) so it runs the same *everywhere*.

- A **Docker image** is a recipe (read-only).
- A **container** is a running instance of that image.
- You define images with a `Dockerfile` → build → run.

```bash
# Build an image from Dockerfile
docker build -t hello .

# Run it (maps port 3000)
docker run -p 3000:3000 hello
```

That’s it—portable apps, fewer “it works on my machine” moments.
