Next.js gives us **two ways of building apps**: the older **Page Router** (`/pages`) and the newer **App Router** (`/app`).  
Here’s the difference explained simply:

---

## The Simple Idea
- **Page Router (old way):**  
  You put files inside `/pages`. Each file = one route. It’s simple, but limited when your app grows.
- **App Router (new way):**  
  You put files inside `/app`. It uses **React Server Components**, layouts, and modern features. It’s more powerful, but needs a bit more learning.

---

## Analogy 🪟

Think of it like building a house:

- **Page Router = separate rooms**. Each room (page) has its own door. If you want a shared wall (like a layout), you must rebuild it in every room.  
- **App Router = house with shared walls**. Rooms (pages) can share layouts, data fetching, and logic without repeating work.

---

## Key Differences 🔑

- **File location:** `/pages` vs `/app`
- **Rendering:** Page Router = fully client-side components; App Router = supports **Server Components**
- **Layouts:** Page Router = no built-in layouts; App Router = nested layouts by default
- **Data fetching:** Page Router = `getServerSideProps` / `getStaticProps`; App Router = async functions inside components (simpler & more flexible)
- **Best for:**  
  - Page Router → quick prototypes, small apps  
  - App Router → modern apps, scalable projects, production-ready

## Code Example

**Page Router**

```tsx
// pages/about.tsx
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}
```

**App Router**

```tsx
// app/about/page.tsx
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}
```

## When to Use?

- ✅ New project → **App Router** (future of Next.js)  
- ✅ Old project already using `/pages` → **stay with Page Router** unless you want to migrate  
- ❌ Don’t mix them in the same route (but you can run both in one project during migration)

That’s it! 🎉
