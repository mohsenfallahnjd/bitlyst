# SOLID Principles Explained Simply

> The SOLID principles are five guidelines that help developers write software that’s easy to maintain, flexible, and easy to change.

---

## 1. **S — Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

Each module or class should have **one reason to change**.  
In simple terms: **do one job, and do it well**.

Bad:
```ts
class Report {
  generate() {/* ... */}
  saveToDatabase() {/* ... */} // ❌ different responsibility
}
```

Good:
```ts
class ReportGenerator { generate() {/* ... */} }
class ReportSaver { saveToDatabase() {/* ... */} }
```

---

## 2. **O — Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**

Software entities should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.  
You should be able to **add new behavior** without touching existing, stable code.

Example:  
Instead of editing a payment processor class every time you add a new method, create a new class implementing the same interface.

---

## 3. **L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

Subclasses should behave like their parent classes.  
Replacing a parent object with a child should **not break your program**.

---

## 4. **I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

Clients should **not depend on methods they don’t use**.  
Create many **small, specific interfaces** instead of a single “god” interface.

---

## 5. **D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

High-level modules should **depend on abstractions**, not on low-level details.  
Abstractions shouldn’t depend on details—**details should depend on abstractions**.

---

### ✨ **Why SOLID Matters**

- ✅ **Easier to maintain** – changes in one place have fewer ripple effects.  
- 🧪 **More testable** – smaller, focused units are easier to test.  
- 🔁 **Reusable & scalable** – modular code can grow without chaos.

### 📌 **Quick Reference**

| Principle | Meaning (Simplified)        |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| SRP       | One job per module/class    |
| OCP       | Extend without modifying    |
| LSP       | Subclasses act like parents |
| ISP       | Use only what you need      |
| DIP       | Depend on abstractions      |
