When you click on an element inside nested elements, the event doesnâ€™t just happen on that element â€” it travels through the DOM. There are **two ways** this can happen: capturing and bubbling.

---

## 1. Event Capturing (trickle down)

- The event starts at the **top** (`document`) and goes **down** through each parent until it reaches the target.  
- Analogy: a grandparent tells a message â†’ parent â†’ child.

---

## 2. Event Bubbling (bubble up)

- The event starts at the **target** element and then goes **up** through the parents until the root (`document`).  
- Analogy: bubbles rise from the bottom of a glass to the top.

---

## 3. Default in JavaScript

- By default, JavaScript uses **bubbling**.  
- To use capturing, pass `true` as the third parameter in `addEventListener`.

```javascript
// Bubbling (default)
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});

// Capturing
div.addEventListener(
  "click",
  () => {
    console.log("DIV clicked during capturing!");
  },
  true // ðŸ‘ˆ capturing enabled
);
```

---

## 4. Event Flow Order

When you click the button:

1. **Capturing phase**: document â†’ body â†’ div â†’ button  
2. **Target phase**: the button itself  
3. **Bubbling phase**: button â†’ div â†’ body â†’ document

---

## 5. Why does this matter?

- **Capturing**: less common, useful if you want to intercept early.  
- **Bubbling**: very common, great for **event delegation** (attach one listener to a parent instead of every child).

---

## ðŸ§  Quick Mental Model

- **Capturing = trickle down** (parent â†’ child)  
- **Bubbling = bubble up** (child â†’ parent)

---

âš¡ Thatâ€™s it! Now you know how events travel in JavaScript.
