When working with branches, you often need to **bring changes from `main` into your feature branch**. There are two main ways to do this: **merge** and **rebase**.

---

## 1. Git Merge

**What it does**: Combines histories by creating a **new merge commit**.  
**History**: Keeps both timelines intact (branching visible).  
**Analogy**: Two rivers join into one bigger river.

```bash
git checkout feature/login
git merge main
```

Result (ASCII):

```
A---B---C  main
     \
      D---E---M  feature/login
```

## 2. Git Rebase

**What it does**: Moves your branch to start **on top of main**, rewriting commits.  
**History**: Linear, no merge commit.  
**Analogy**: Pretend you started work after mainâ€™s latest changes.

```bash
git checkout feature/login
git rebase main
```

Result (ASCII):

```
A---B---C---D'---E'  feature/login
```

## 3. When to Use

- **Merge** âœ…  
  - Shared branches.  
  - Preserves history exactly.  
  - Default in big teams.  

- **Rebase** âœ…  
  - Personal feature branches (before PR/MR).  
  - Clean, linear history.  
  - Avoid on public/shared branches (rewrites history).

---

## 4. Quick Mental Model ðŸ§ 

- **Merge** = "Add a commit that says: we combined work."  
- **Rebase** = "Replay my work as if I started from your latest state."

---

## 5. Interview Answer

*"Merge preserves history with a merge commit, while rebase rewrites commits on top of the target branch for a linear history. Use merge for shared branches, and rebase to clean up local branches before merging."*

âš¡ Thatâ€™s it! Now you know when to use `merge` vs `rebase`.
