## 🚦 What does "single-threaded" mean?

- A **thread** is like a worker that can do tasks.  
- **JavaScript has only one worker** (one thread).  
- That worker can **do only one thing at a time**.  

So if JS is running some code, it **cannot** start another piece of code at the same exact time on another thread.

---

## 🛑 Why does this matter?

- If one task is **slow** (e.g. a heavy loop or waiting for a file), the single worker gets **stuck**.  
- This means your whole app (like a webpage) may **freeze** until the task finishes.

---

## 🍕 Analogy

Imagine a **pizza chef** in a small restaurant:

- There’s only **one chef** (single thread).  
- If the chef is busy making a pizza, he cannot simultaneously make pasta.  
- To handle waiting times (like pizza baking in the oven), the chef can **set a timer** and move to the next order.  
- That timer is like **callbacks, promises, or async/await**.

---

## ⚡ How does JS still feel fast?

JavaScript uses the **event loop + asynchronous operations**:

- Slow tasks (network calls, timers, etc.) are handed off to the **browser / Node.js background helpers**.  
- When they’re done, they say “Hey, I’m ready” and the single thread picks it up later.  

This makes JS *feel* like it’s multitasking, even though only one thing runs at a time.

## 💻 Code Example

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Async task done");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
```

### Output

```
Start
End
Async task done
```

👉 Even though the timeout is `0ms`, the callback is delayed until the main thread finishes current tasks (`Start` and `End`).  
This proves that **JavaScript has only one main thread**.

---

## ✅ Summary

JavaScript is **single-threaded** = one main worker runs tasks one after another.  
With the **event loop + async**, it can still handle multiple tasks smoothly without blocking.
